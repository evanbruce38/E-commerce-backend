  ## Description

  * This application is a project created to allow a user to update their catalog of products within an online database. This was part of a series of challenges I completed through the University of Miami coding bootcamp. For this assignment I was given starter code and tasked with creating the code to allow for the functions GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for categories, products, and tags within the database. This project was created using MySQL2, Express, dotenv, and sequelize.
